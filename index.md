description: 1.12.2 anarchy client :)

### postman client
this client was started for fun as a project to help with my java and coding in general.
postman is a client for Minecraft 1.12.2 intended for use on servers which allow client-side modification. this client is not intended for and is of no use on servers which do not
allow it. postman takes inspiration from a few clients credited in the code and on the github, and uses Zeros Alpine for an event system and lukflugs panelstudio for the clickGui, 
so thank you to all mentioned! this wouldnâ€™t be possible without them. i intend for this project to be as community driven as possible, no private access, no private development, 
every beta release is public and free to use!
