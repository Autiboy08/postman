# postman
this client was started as a project to help with my coding, and for fun. 

postman is a client for Minecraft 1.12.2 intended for use on servers which allow client-side modification. this client not intended for and is of no use for servers which do not allow it. postman takes inspiration from both GameSense and kami-blue, and uses Zeros Alpine event system, so thank you to all mentioned! this wouldnt be possible without them. i intend for this project to be as community driven as possible, no private access, no private development, every beta release is public and free to use! and with this GitHub, the client is now officially open source.

this client is on Minecraft 1.12.2, Forge version 1.12.2-14.23.5.2768, and Alpine 1.5.

thank you,
